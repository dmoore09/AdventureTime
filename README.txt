TODO: Write a brief description of your game here -- the setting,
the plot, the commands you can use, and a short summary of how
someone playing your game would win it (from start to finish).

In my game the player wakes up in a mysterious room. He does not know where
he is, and he must try to escape. To defeat the game the player must 
walk through all the rooms, find the oldKey and then use the oldKey in the 
first room of the game to unlock the second door. The commands the user
must input to win are:

go right
take letter
go ahead
go ahead
take oldKey
go left

at this point the player must make a desicion to go left or right. If a 
player goes right he will be led to a dead end, if the player goes left
he will be at the first room again

go left
use oldKey

After using the old key the user will have escaped and won the game


If you did any extra work beyond the requirements listed in the
project description, write about them here too.

I added in a use command. This command allows the user to use the oldKey
object to unlock the door and win the game
